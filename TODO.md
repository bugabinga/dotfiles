# TODO

- [x] remove cosmopolitan from git
- [ ] add download script for cross9 and cosmopolitan
  - [x] win32
  - [ ] linux 
- [ ] what do we do about ssh and gpg keys? or secrets in general?
  - [x] say goodbye to gpg, too hard for me...
- [ ] how to handle finding the symlink file in bootstripper? turns out, getting path of executable is not trivial.
- [ ] cosmopolitan exe rewrites itself on first use. how do we handle this so a pristine copy is in git...?
